Hi, This is the organising team of this event.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>We are proud to present the first ever CTF style event held in IIT (ISM) Dhanbad</p><!-- qowifjqwoeijfoqweijfqweoifjqweofijqweoqwoijefoqwijefoijfqiwoefjj -->
<span>Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competition. </span><!- oqwipjefqwioefjwioqfjoiqwjfeioqwjefoi --><p>Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensics, Cryptography, Binary or something else. As the name of the event suggests, you, the participants, are expected to make your way through a web environment, finding all the "flags" that may be hidden in the environment. To make it simple, each of the individual flags has been hidden in various modules. You have to go through each of the modules and find the flags by doing what you see fit. You have your freedom to use the internet for your assistance. Good Luck!
May the best team win!!!</p><p>May the source be with you .</p>
