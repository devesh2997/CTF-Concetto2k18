<span>Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competition. </span><!- oqwipjefqwioefjwioqfjoiqwjfeioqwjefoi --><p>Jeopardy-style CTFs has a set of questions (tasks) in a plethora of categories,for example, Web, Forensics, Cryptography,and Binary Reversing. As the name of the event suggests, you, the participants, are expected to make your way through a web environment, finding all the "flags" that may be hidden in the environment. To make it simple, each of the individual flags has been hidden in various modules. You have to go through each of the modules and find the flags by doing what you see fit. You have your freedom to use the internet for your assistance. Good Luck!
May the best team win!!!</p><p>May the source be with you .</p>
