                <p id='question_text'>Siri has been very bored with her job as Appleâ€™s voice assistant lately. Frustrated, she decided to spend her time flipping coins. The results of the coin flips are in this file, with each bit representing the outcome of one flip. A run is any consecutive sequence of the same bit. Siri now wants to know how many runs of flips she found. For example, the flips 001111101011 have three runs of length one, two runs of length two, and one run of length five. Siri has been kind enough to share your flag with you, which is the sum of runs of all lengths. For example, the flag for this byte sequence is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.</p>

A run is any consecutive sequence of the same flip. For example, the flips 001111101011 have three runs of length one, two runs of length two, and one run of length five.
